I am Odin Zhang, also known as Haotian Zhang. I established this repository to disseminate the scripts and functions I have utilized in the realm of computer-aided drug discovery. The scope of this repository is extensive, encapsulating diverse topics ranging from the computation of a molecule's electronic density and the subsequent mapping of this value to a user-specified box, to the exploration of various fragmentation strategies for structural modifications, such as linkers, fragments, scaffolds, and side-chains. You can learn more about me and my work on my [Homepage](https://haotianzhangai4science.github.io/). 

I sincerely hope that these resources will prove advantageous in your own research!
